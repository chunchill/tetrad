6.8.0
Added Testwise Deletion for Fisher Z, G Square, Chi Square, Conditional Gaussian Test, Degenerate Gaussian Test, KCI Test, Conditional Correlation Test, Probabilistic Test
Added the Junction Tree Inference; that’s incorporated as an "Updater" as well in the Tetrad interface
Added a backdoor criterion method to the code
Added a joint probability method to the code
Added FASK and MultiFASK algorithm
Added Degenerate Gaussian Score and Likelihood Ratio Test
Added Experimental option (by default experimental algorithms, scores, tests are not shown)
Changed “Sample prior” to “Prior Equivalent Sample Size”
Changed default percentage of discrete variables for mixed variable simulation to 50%
Changed default discrete independence test to G Square
Fixed saving SEM models as XML
Fixed simulation so you can’t re-simulate data for the same model (fixes a problem for causal compare)
Fixed the independence test comparison tool in the interface
Fixed LiNGAM
